Run `npx ng test` to execute the unit tests via [jest] the tests are failed, i could n't have time to build other cases.

i have just adjust some test case in other component but i couldn't figure it out because of time and the deadline. Please also take a look

## Running end-to-end tests

I was planning to do Cyprus end to end test and as i was saying deadline is on the way so i cannot do it.

## In Future

If it possible then give me some more time to do the unit test
